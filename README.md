# [WC:S Reignited] Daily Quests

## About
When this plugin is installed on your Warcraft-Source server, then players will be able to type !quest or !dailyquest in the chat. Doing so will award the player with 5 to 10 levels in his current race, alternatively you can choose to have the levels deposited directly in to the player's Levelbank. You can choose to have the player hear a sound upon completing the quest as well. You can also choose to award the player with a static number of levels instead of a random amount.


Note: 
All of the values mentioned are default values, and can easily be adjusted in the autogenerated configuration file.
